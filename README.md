## About

**DankLyrics:** A lyrics finder API, Website and Go package!

# Go Package Docs

DankLyrics provides a Go package, since the project is written in Go lol.

Here's a sample usage, it's pretty straight forward, as the client only has one method :)

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/mbaraa/danklyrics/pkg/client"
	"github.com/mbaraa/danklyrics/pkg/provider"
)

func main() {
	lyricser, err := client.NewHttp(client.Config{
        // available providers are the following in addition to Genius, and you need to provide client id and token to use it.
		Providers: []provider.Name{provider.Dank, provider.LyricFind},
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	searchInput := provider.SearchParams{
		SongName: "sos",
        ArtistName: "abba",
	}
    lyrics, err := lyricser.GetSongLyrics(searchInput)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

    fmt.Println(lyrics.String())
    fmt.Println(lyrics.Parts)
    fmt.Println(lyrics.Synced)
}
```
